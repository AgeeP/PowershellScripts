## ðŸ“˜ Commands

```powershell
Invoke-FolderEncode - Encode folder
  [-DestFolder] <string>
  [-SrcFolder] <string> (Optional)
```

## ðŸ“ƒ Usage

```powershell
/>Invoke-FolderEncode -DestFolder "d:\System\" -SrcFolder "c:\windows\System42"
/> cd c:\Windows; Invoke-FolderEncode "d:\backup\" #use current folder as src
```

## Decoding

There is no decoding script. Because currently used only for backups and(thank goodness) there was no necessity to decode it.
To decrypt manually:

There were no reasons (thank goodness) decoding stored data so currently there no decoder script.
If you need - please create GitHub issue and I'll add a script for folder decoding.

Manually files can be decoded with the next algorithm:
1 Concat value from .masterKey and add ':' to the beginning and by using resulting key extract .keys file from .keys.7z

2 Find the appropriate row in .key for a file that should be decoded.

3 Concat first row from .masterKey with the first row from .key file and ':' to beginning

4 Use the key from the previous step as 7z password for decode file
