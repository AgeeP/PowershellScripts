## Decoding

There is no decoding script. Because currently used only for backups and(thank goodness) there was no necessity to decode it.
To decrypt manually:

There was no reasons (thank goodness) decoding stored data so currently there no decoder script.
It you need - please create github issue and I'll add scrpit for folder decoding.

Manually files can be decoded with the next algorithm:
1 Concat value from .masterKey and add ':' to beginign and by using resulting key extract .keys file from .keys.7z

2 Find apropriate row in .key for file that shoudl be decoded.

3 Concat first row from .masterKey with first row from .key file and ':' to beginign

4 Use key from previouse step as 7z password for decode file
