## Motivation

The modules are created and actively maintained during evenings and weekends for my own needs.
If it's useful for you too, that's great. I don't demand anything in return.

However, if you like it and feel the urge to give something back,
a coffee or a beer is always appreciated. Thank you very much in advance.
